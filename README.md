Nutri-Tracker

Description: 
  Our app allows you to track your nutrition, specifically your daily calorie intake. 
You're able to update your calorie goal settings, look up specific foods you consumed during the day, monitor your calorie consumption,
and then push it to your Fitbit account assuming you're logged in. You can use it without a Fitbit account, but it will not 
synchronize across your devices in that case.

New Technologies:
  Fitbit API
  Nutritionix API
  Oauth
  Axios
  Bulma
