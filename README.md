# Squirtle-Squad
First Project

The main objective of this App is to create a simlified way of keeping track of calories consumed which will directly connect with your fitbit or on their local device. If using fitbit with this app, it will track through all devices. The nutrients are not stored however and would be added in future updates.

The application CSS styling is done using Bulma.

The application is limited by the amount of calls it is allowd to make so if no results are given, the limits have been exceeded.

The technologies used in this were Oauth, Axios
